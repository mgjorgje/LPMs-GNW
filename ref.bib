abstract = {This is a concise text developed from lecture notes and ready to be used for a course on the graduate level. The main idea is to introduce the fundamental concepts of the theory while maintaining the exposition suitable for a first approach in the field. Therefore, the results are not always given in the most general form but rather under assumptions that lead to shorter or more elegant proofs. The book has three chapters. Chapter 1 presents basic nonparametric regression and density estimators and analyzes their properties. Chapter 2 is devoted to a detailed treatment of minimax lower bounds. Chapter 3 develops more advanced topics: Pinskers theorem, oracle inequalities, Stein shrinkage, and sharp minimax adaptivity. This book will be useful for researchers and grad students interested in theoretical aspects of smoothing techniques. Many important and useful results on optimal and adaptive estimation are provided. As one of the leading mathematical statisticians working in nonparametrics, the author is an authority on the subject.}

 abstract = {Let $H\colon L_{2}(S,\scr{I},P)\mapsto L_{2}(S,\scr{I},P)$ be a compact integral operator with a symmetric kernel h. Let Xi, i∈ N, be independent S-valued random variables with common probability law P. Consider the n × n matrix H̃n with entries n-1h(Xi,Xj), 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n (this is the matrix of an empirical version of the operator H with P replaced by the empirical measure Pn), and let Hn denote the modification of H̃n, obtained by deleting its diagonal. It is proved that the l2 distance between the ordered spectrum of Hn and the ordered spectrum of H tends to zero a.s. if and only if H is Hilbert-Schmidt. Rates of convergence and distributional limit theorems for the difference between the ordered spectra of the operators Hn (or H̃n) and H are also obtained under somewhat stronger conditions. These results apply in particular to the kernels of certain functions H = φ(L) of partial differential operators L (heat kernels, Green functions).},
